# Playing around with Julia for Evo-MWC
This repo is inspired and related to by https://github.com/mrazomej/evo_mwc.

In this repo I want to practice my Julia skills and work on optimization, while trying to write some code that is
useful for the Evo-MWC project.
Some things I want to try out:
- `StaticArrays.jl` to optimize memory allocation for fixed arrays.
- some of the optimization stuff I saw in this [presentation](https://github.com/mfalt/juliacourse/blob/master/lecture3/performance.pdf).
- writing the Gaussian Process inference from scratch here to fully understand what is going on using STAN
- keeping a clean and organized repository
- test driven development
